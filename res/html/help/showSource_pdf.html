	<h1>Show Source - PDF (Author)</h1>

	<div class="section">
		<h2>PDF Controls</h2>
		<p>An array of built-in PDF manipulation tools is provided for your convenience. These include buttons to flip through pages, zoom in or out for better readability, enter fullscreen mode for focused viewing, and more—all embedded within the viewer interface for streamlined access.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h2>Open</h2>
		<p>Clicking this option will attempt to launch the selected PDF file in your computer's default external PDF viewer. This allows you to use advanced features outside of the app, but may fail if your system has no default viewer configured.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h2>Download</h2>
		<p>Allows you to save the current PDF file to your device. You'll be prompted to choose the destination folder and filename, making it easy to back up or share the file outside the app.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="section">
		<h2>Edit</h2>
		<p>This option lets you modify the description or metadata of the selected PDF source. Useful for correcting mistakes or adding additional context after initial submission.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="section">
		<h2>Delete</h2>
		<p>Permanently removes the source from your list. This action cannot be undone, so use caution—especially if the PDF is not saved elsewhere.</p>
