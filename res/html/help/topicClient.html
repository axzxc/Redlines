      <li><strong>Number of Secondary Sources</strong> – Count of supplementary materials offering commentary, interpretation, or contextual insight.</li>
      <li><strong>Number of Related Topics</strong> – Number of thematically or structurally connected topics that help broaden understanding.</li>
      <li><strong>Topic Author</strong> – Username or identifier of the individual who originally compiled or authored this topic.</li>
      <li><strong>Topic Size</strong> – Storage size of the topic, including all its assets (sources, metadata, annotations, etc.).</li>

    <h2>Author Status</h2>
    <p>Displays the real-time connectivity status of the topic's author, helping you gauge the likelihood of receiving timely annotation responses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unreachable</strong> – The author's client ID (CID) is currently offline or cannot be located; communication is not possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Connected & Closed</strong> – The author is online but has not opened this topic, so they won’t see annotations unless they reopen it.</li>

    </ul>
  </div>
