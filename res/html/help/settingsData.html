  <h1>Settings - Data Management</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Total Used Space</h2>
    <p>Displays the total space currently used by your locally stored Redlines topics, not including core application files. Useful for monitoring disk usage and ensuring efficient storage management.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Export</h2>
    <p>Exports all your saved topics and their associated data into a single '.tc' (topic container) file. Youâ€™ll be prompted to choose a destination on your machine. This is ideal for backing up or transferring your topics.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Import</h2>
    <p>Allows you to load a previously exported '.tc' file into Redlines, restoring its topics and contents into your environment. This feature is useful for syncing across devices or restoring backups.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Max Topic Size</h2>
    <p>Set a soft cap (in gigabytes) for the maximum allowable size of any individual topic. This helps prevent runaway storage use or excessively large topics that may impact performance.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Clear all Topics</h2>
    <p>Immediately and permanently removes all currently stored topics from Redlines. Use this option with caution, as this action is irreversible and cannot be undone.</p>
  </div>
